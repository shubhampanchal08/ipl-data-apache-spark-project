# ipl-data-apache-spark-project
##Quections solved in this project:

###1)Filter to include only valid deliveries (excluding extras like wides and no balls for specific analyses)
###2)Aggregation: Calculate the total and average runs scored in each match and inning
###3)# Window Function: Calculate running total of runs in each match for each over
###4)Conditional Column: Flag for high impact balls (either a wicket or more than 6 runs including extras)
###5)Extracting year, month, and day from the match date for more detailed time-based analysis
###6)High margin win: categorizing win margins into 'high', 'medium', and 'low'
###7)Analyze the impact of the toss: who wins the toss and the match
###8)Normalize and clean player names
###9)Handle missing values in 'batting_hand' and 'bowling_skill' with a default 'unknown'
###10)Categorizing players based on batting hand
###11)Add a 'veteran_status' column based on player age
###12)Dynamic column to calculate years since debut
###13)Visualizing using Matplotlib for economical_bowlers
###14)Creating a countplot to show win/loss after winning toss
###15)Using seaborn to plot average runs in winning matches
###16)Convert to Pandas DataFrame for scores_by_venue
###17)Convert to Pandas DataFrame for dismissal_types
